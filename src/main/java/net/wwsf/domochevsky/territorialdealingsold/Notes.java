/*
b13
- Updated to 1.9
- Change: Not sending any chat messages on payday if the upkeep cost is set to 0. (Since nothing gets deducted.)

b14
- Fixed client-side model loading happening on server side (Doesn't really work, now does it.)

b15
- Did some minor adjustments, to be compatible with Forge build 1907.
- Fixed client side chat formatting being called on server side
- Did another minor adjustment, so save and upkeep don't tick faster than they should. Let's hope that works!

b15b
- Some more adjustments to the whole chat formatting thing. Looks like I missed a few calls.

b16
- Minor fix: Tried to cancel an event that cannot be cancelled. That should be fixed now. (But the function itself is still a hackish workaround. Still pondering how to improve upon that.)

b17
- Updated to 1.10.* and made some preparations for an internal overhaul.
