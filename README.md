This is a mod for Minecraft that adds various items to start a faction, claim territory in the name of that faction and then have a go at other player’s territories.

There are two versions here. One is the half-finished overhaul (b18) and the other is the commented out, functioning old version (b17). 
(Commented out as in "the mod header in the Main class was commented out, to not be recognized by Forge.)
That will have to be adressed first before you can compile this mod.
